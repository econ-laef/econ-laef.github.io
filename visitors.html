								<p>
							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/Pretnar1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>  
							 Nick Pretnar is a postdoctoral scholar whose research resides at the intersection of structural macroeconomics, behavioral economics, and consumer theory. He is particularly focused on studying the aggregate impacts of households’ time utilization decisions. He also examines the effects of population aging on aggregate growth and inequality, consumer-level spending and budgeting behavior, credit card utilization behavior, and female labor force participation differentials amongst advanced economies. He is trained in the implementation, analysis, and estimation of structural models, with a particular focus on Bayesian estimation techniques. Nick graduated from Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business in 2020 with a PhD in economics. He is the recipient of several grants and awards, including an NSF-GRFP grant and Tepper’s prestigious Alexander Henderson Award for advances in Economic Theory.
