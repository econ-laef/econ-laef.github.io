He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, Distinguished Fellow of the AEA, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Econometric Society, and the Society of Labor Economists.
 Along with his Hoover Institution colleague Alvin Rabushka, they developed a framework for equitable and efficient consumption taxation. Their article in the Wall Street Journal in December 1981 was the starting point for an upsurge of interest in consumption taxation. Their book, The Flat Tax spells out the proposal. (for a free download of the book from the Hoover Institution Press, please go to <a href="http://www.hoover.org/research/flat-tax/">http://www.hoover.org/research/flat-tax/.</a> They were recognized in Money magazine’s Hall of Fame for their contributions to financial innovation.

								<h2>Nicholas Pretnar - Economics PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.</h2>

							<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="seminars-test/Pretnar.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Nick Pretnar, who'll be visiting LAEF from CMU will present, "Why Do Income Effects Exist?: Structural Change with Micro Foundations". His research focusses on consumption/savings behavior particularly how behavioral tendencies at microeconomic household level impact broader, macroeconomic trends. Currently, his research is bifurcated, focussing on how individual savings rates can be improved by financial services innovations, and how today’s consumption/savings behavior may have future generational welfare implications as society skews older. </p>
