										<h2>Leif Eiriksson</h2>
										<p>Founding Father</p>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/lerikson.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>LAEF similates the Norwegian pronunciation of Leif, as in Leif Eiriksson, the great explorer and first European discoverer of North America. And exploration and discovery is what LAEF is all about! He established a Norse settlement at Vinland, tentatively identified with the Norse L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland in modern-day Canada. Leif's successful expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to also make the journey. Leif was described as a wise, considerate, and strong man of striking appearance. </p>
