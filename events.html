						</header>
						<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images_conf/newfrontier.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
						The conference commemorates Thomas Cooley’s edited volume “Frontiers of Business Cycle Research”.  The conference will present recent important contributions to business cycle research, and will be the opportunity to discuss the progress made in the field since the book was commissioned 25 years ago. As in Cooley’s volume, the conference will explore applications of dynamic methods to different aspects of the business cycle, including issues related to labor markets, financial factors, fiscal and monetary policies, and international cycles.  Organizers are Zachary Bethune, Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Virginia, Sophie Osotimehin, Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Virginia, and Eric Young, Professor of Economics at the University of Virginia. The conference will take place at the Upham Hotel Garden room Friday March 2 and Saturday March 3, 2018.</p>

							<p>The Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance (LAEF) at the University of California, Santa Barbara is pleased to announce the second LAEF OTC Markets and Securities Conference. The meeting will take place at The Upham Hotel in Santa Barbara, Friday October 13, and Saturday October 14, 2017.

The conference theme will be on three sets of topics: (1) over-the-counter (OTC) markets, market-microstructure, and networks; (2) "corporate finance" issues related to OTC traded securities (e.g. the treatment of derivative and repo contracts in bankruptcy, their effective seniority in bankruptcy, or any other contractual issues surrounding OTC traded securities); (3) the relationship between these topics with the financial crisis and macroeconomics.</p>

							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images_conf/LAEF_fiscal.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>In 2017, the federal government budgeted $4.1 trillion for expenditures, or roughly 22% of GDP. The goal of this conference is to bring researchers together to discuss the effects of such a large and expanding fiscal budget. How should these expenditures be financed? Should fiscal policy have a role in short-term macroeconomic stabilization? Is there a link between budget deficits and inflation? Broadly, we seek to ask “why the government does whatever it is that the government does (and should they be doing it)?”</p>

									<h2> Bubbles</h2>
										<p>February 24-25, 2017</p>
											</header>
								<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images_conf/bubbles.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<p>
							Many popular accounts of the economy assign an important role to bubbles, but the exact meaning of this term is unclear; it seems to mean simply a large increase in, for example, an asset price. In contrast, in the academic literature a bubble is a deviation from the fundamental equilibrium, but that leaves open the issue of what the right fundamentals are -- that uncertainty means it is difficult to spot a bubble in the data. Related to bubbles are other expectations-driven deviations from fundamental outcomes, including sunspots, self-fulfilling prophecies, and animal spirits, that involve agents making choices based on beliefs that end up justifying the beliefs. The goal of this conference is to bring together researchers working on many aspects of these economic phenomena to explore questions including (i) how one identifies a bubble or other non-fundamental equilibria in the data, (ii) whether non-fundamental equilibria can help us understand the dynamics of asset markets, and (iii) what governments should do about them.

							The conference organizers are Zachary Bethune, Assistant Professor of Economics, Ana Fostel, Associate Professor of Economics, and Eric Young, Professor of Economics, all from the University of Virginia.

									<h2> What We Know About Information in Financial Markets</h2>

						The Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance (LAEF) at the University of California, Santa Barbara is pleased to announce a conference entitled "What We Know About Information in Financial Markets" at The Upham Hotel in Santa Barbara, Friday November 18, and Saturday November 19, 2016.

							The recent financial crisis featured unprecedented disruptions in financial markets. The volume of trade fell across a broad array of assets classes and eventually led to significant effects on the balance sheets of banks, firms and households. In many of these markets, assets are traded in opaque, over-the- counter markets in which participants may be unaware of all the information or prices in the relevant for trade. The focus of this conference is to bring together researchers working at the forefront of understanding the effects of incomplete information in financial markets and how regulation can be designed to improve welfare.

						The academic organizers of the conference are Eric Young, Professor of Economics, and Zach Bethune, Assistant Professor of Economics, both at the University of Virginia.

							<p>
						Santa Barbara, California, August 29, 2016 - UC Santa Barbara's Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance presents Dr. Finn Kydland, Economic Science Nobel Laureate 2004, giving a free public lecture "A peek behind the curtain: Impressions from North Korea" in UCSB Corwin Pavilion at 5 pm on Tuesday, October 18. A reception for Dr. Kydland will follow immediately after the talk and a Q&A session.

						The International Peace Foundation, a Vienna-based private organization that promotes peace through science, held a week-long program of events May 2 to 6 in Pyongyang dubbed "Bridges - Dialogue Towards a Culture of Peace," to engage North Korea in what the group called "silent diplomacy." A group of Nobel laureates visited for rare academic exchanges amid heightened tensions over the country's nuclear development. The three laureates who attended were Finn Kydland from Norway, Aaron Ciechanover from Israel, and Richard Roberts from Britain. They won their Nobel prizes for economic science, chemistry and medicine, respectively.

							Through the program, the delegation held workshops, seminars and dialogues with students and scholars from various educational institutions at Kim Chaek University of Technology and the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. The events were aimed at inspiring North Korea's "young generation" and strengthening "international understanding by building long-term bridges" between the visiting scholars and local universities.

					<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images_conf/invisible_hand.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
							The past eight years have seen the global economy experience of a number of severe financial crises, including the subprime crisis in the US and the European debt crisis. These events share the characteristic that small initial shocks, concentrated within a particular part of the economy, eventually spread through financial markets and prices, leading to widespread turmoil. In response to these and similar events in emerging market economies, researchers have analyzed models of "macro-prudential" policymaking, or policies aimed at preventing the onset of financial crises as opposed to those that act to mitigate the severity of crises once they begin. The goal of this conference is to bring together researchers studying the interaction of pecuniary externalities and policy; from those studying international capital flows and "sudden stops", in which foreign capital abruptly flees the domestic economy, to those studying domestic banking crises.

							The academic organizers of the conference are Eric Young, Professor of Economics, and Zach Bethune, Assistant Professor of Economics, both at the University of Virginia.

								Welcome to the 2nd Annual Workshop of the Australasian Macroeconomics Society (WAMS). The 2015 edition of the WAMS will be held in Brisbane, Australia, and it is jointly organized with the Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance. The second Workshop Australasian Macroeconomics Society (WAMS), hosted by the UNSW Australia, Business School and School of Economics, Sydney, Australia, welcomes submissions in all areas of macroeconomics.

								The workshop has 3 principal purposes. First, it is an opportunity for Australasian macroeconomists to share and discuss their results and ideas with each other, to encourage excellence and collaboration in research in macroeconomics in Australasia. Second, by bringing top international researchers here, the workshop aims to help connect researchers here with top people from around the world in a two-way learning process. Third, by bringing together both theoretical and applied researchers, the workshop aims to foster synergies between and across all modern scientific approaches to macroeconomics.

								Plenary speakers: Professor Randall Wright University of Wisconsin, Madison Professor George Evans, University of Oregon, and Professor Finn Kydland, UCSB and LAEF.

							<h2>Ambiguity and  Robustness in Economics </h2>
								<p>March 13-14, 2015</p>
											</header>
						<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images_conf/ambiguity.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
Economists, mathematicians, psychologists and other researchers have developed theories about how people react when faced with uncertainty, i.e., something that they do not understand completely and also may be in conflict with what they believe to be the case. Consider, for example, the situation where you have no news and do not know the probability for rain to occur today. Should you go out without your umbrella and risk getting wet? An ambiguous individual will react by taking into account the worst possible state that can occur, i.e., what will happen if she goes out without an umbrella. In economics and finance a key issue is how individuals will negotiate the terms of a contact in ambiguous situations. They would like to write incentive compatible and efficient contacts. Can this be done? Can ambiguity prevent an individual from being cheated in a contract, making it beneficial? What about a government or firm that makes decisions about the future of the economy or the firm? Should the decision-maker adopt risky policies that could lead to bankruptcy or should the decision-maker hedge against the worst possible state that can occur to avoid bankruptcy?

Related to such questions, there is a new stream of thought in asymmetric information economies based on non-expected utility theory (ambiguity/robustness). When we deal with uncertainty, the choice of Expected Utility (EU) plays an important role. Even with the same primitives in an economy, if one computes a certain equilibrium concept with different Expected Utilities (which means a different functional form, as different expected utilities provide alternative functional forms) one will get different results. But then, which formulation of EU is better? Can one compare Expected Utilities, and on what criteria?

Such questions have led economists to adopt ideas from statistics/mathematics, e.g., robust optimization, robust control, robust contracts, robust implementation, ambiguity, etc. The objective of our conference is to bring together researchers on the above topics to find out what has been achieved, explore common grounds, see where the new path is leading us and perhaps raise further questions. The conference is being organized by Nicholas Yannelis, University of Iowa.

                    This conference aims to discuss policy choices in the aftermath of the Great Recession. It will examine the issues both from the perspective of developed and emerging economies. From the viewpoint of developed economies, the conference will discuss the implications of forward guidance in monetary policy as well as fiscal policy issues. The conference also seeks to inject a historical and institutionalist perspective in the policy discussion by examining the implications of cultural differences in the EU as well as the historical experience of financial crises. Finally, the conference aims to provide empirical evidence regarding key policy choices facing emerging economies in terms of the effects of capital controls and the derivation of an index of financial conditions. The attendance is likely to be around 100 participants, with academics, business economists as well as practitioners from policy institutions such as the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, the Istanbul Bourse, and others. The participation of the TUSIAD Chairman in providing opening comments as well as the policy panel at its conclusion are also likely to lead to significant press coverage and attendance.</p>

													<p>
										On September 26-27, 2014, The Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University and the Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance at UC Santa Barbara will host the annual conference entitled “5th Advances in Macro-Finance,” designed to bring together leading scholars in the field. The conference will focus on research on the relationship between asset prices and macroeconomic fundamentals. Topics will include, but are not limited to: production economies; exotic preferences; time variation in expected returns; learning; and pricing currencies, commodities and sovereign debt. Preference has been given to recent papers that had not previously been presented at major conferences. To the extent possible, the organizers have paired authors to discussant with different backgrounds (macroeconomics and finance), with senior academics discussing the work of junior colleagues. The conference organizers are Brent Glover and Ariel Zetlin-Jones, both assistant professors at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. </p>

								<h2>On Money as a Medium of Exchange: KW at 25!  </h2>

								<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images_conf/firm financing.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Twenty-five years ago, Nobu Kiyotaki and Randy Wright (1989) published a paper that introduced a new approach, based on search theory, into monetary economics. In this approach, agents in the model trade with each other, and not simply against their budget lines. This allows one to start asking how they trade - using barter, commodity or fiat money, secured or unsecured credit, etc. Over the last twenty-five years much progress has been made in the area, applying and extending the original model on many dimensions. This conference provides an opportunity to look back at what has been done, and to look forward to where monetary economics will go in the future.

										<h2> Dynamic Policy Design with Human Capital </h2>
									<p>December 13-14, 2013</p>
													</header>
									<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images_conf/dynamic_policy.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This conference brings together two groups to discuss optimal dynamic policies for fostering human capital formation.  One group uses the mechanism design of optimal policies with human capital, typically with a limited framework for human capital production, while the other thinks more deeply about human capital formation (cognitive vs. non-cognitive skills, early childhood investments, etc.), but typically considers ad-hoc policy reforms.  The goal is to have a mix of presentations and participants from both of these areas over two days.

									The academic organizers of the conference are Marek Kapicka, Associate Professor of Economics, University of California, Santa Barbara; Lance Lochner, Professor and Director, CIBC Centre for Human Capital and Productivity, University of Western Ontario; and Peter Rupert, Professor of Economics and Associate Director, Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance, University of California, Santa Barbara. The conference is co-sponsored by the Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Global Working Group at the University of Chicago.

									<h2> Accounting for Accounting in Economics </h2>
												<p>November 8-9, 2013</p>
												</header>
											<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images_conf/acct_for_acct.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The recent global financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession suggest that accounting practices may have real economic consequences.  Lax enforcement and outright fraud have been advanced as contributing factors both to the initial crash and the subsequent slow recovery, as many firms were found to be obscuring or misreporting their liabilities and exposure to risk.  The purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers from the fields of economics and accounting to discuss common methods and topics, including the effects of financial misreporting on asset prices, the importance of credit reporting for economic activity, and the role of disclosure requirements in industry dynamics.

		<h2> Demography for Economists </h2>
	<p>September 27-28, 2013</p>
	</header>
<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images_conf/Stern Logo.CGEB09-13.jpg" alt="" /></a>
<p> This two-day conference sponsored jointly by LAEF and the Center for Business and Global Economy at NYU will focus on issues at the intersection of demography and economics.  Demographic changes are persistent and slow moving and over the past decades there have been dramatic changes in demography – decreased mortality and morbidity, lower birth rates and changing age structure of the population.  This conference will explore the current state of demographic research and the implications of demographic change for important economic issues – the structure of the family, capital flows, savings behavior and the fiscal condition of economies.  The academic organizers of the conference are David Backus, Heinz Riehl Professorship in Finance and Economics, Department of Economics, Volatility Institute, and Glucksman Institute for Research in Securities Markets, and Thomas Cooley, Paganelli-Bull Professor of Business and International Trade, Department of Economics-Business & Society Program Area, Volatility Institute, and Glucksman Institute for Research in Securities Markets.</p>
